Project Name_Implementing a design from scratch.

#description of how awesome this project has really being for me, it has really made me spend more time or research and watching on videos on the internet than every other time i can literally think of and how i was able to meet up with the time and also beig able to get the work done is wonderful even if i get to skip a part of the work. in a nutshell, this projects aims to make use of the knowledge of HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design that we learned previously in the past weeks to have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file without any instruction whatsoever..
